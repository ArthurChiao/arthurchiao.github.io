This post will show how to use [`ab`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) - the
Apache benchmark tool for measureing HTTP server performances.

## 1 Setup Test Env

Refer to our previous posts [1,2] for how to setup a test environment like this:

## 2 Setup Server And Client

### 2.1 Server

Treat `ctn-2` as our http server.

```shell
$ docker exec -it ctn-2 sh
```

In container, install nginx:

```shell
/ # apk update && dpk add nginx
```

If `/run/nginx` dir not exist, create it:

```shell
/ # [ ! -d /run/nginx ] && mkdir /run/nginx
```

Reload nginx:

```shell
/ # nginx -s reload
/ # ps -ef | grep nginx
37 root       0:00 nginx: master process nginx
38 nginx      0:01 nginx: worker process
39 nginx      0:01 nginx: worker process
40 nginx      0:00 nginx: worker process
```

### 2.2 Client

`ctn-1` as our client.

```shell
$ docker exec -it ctn-2 sh
```

In container, install `ab`:

```shell
/ # apk update && apk add apache2-utils

/ # ab -h
Usage: ab [options] [http[s]://]hostname[:port]/path
Options are:
    -n requests     Number of requests to perform
    -c concurrency  Number of multiple requests to make at a time
    ...
```

## 3 Functionality Test

100 concurrent requests per second, total 1000 requests (10s), use `HEAD` instead
of `GET` (`-i`), don't exit on socket receive errors (`-r`):

```shell
$ ab -c 100 -i -n 1000 -r http://192.168.1.4:80/
Benchmarking 192.168.1.4 (be patient)
Completed 100 requests
...
Finished 1000 requests

Server Software:        nginx
Server Hostname:        192.168.1.4
Server Port:            80

Concurrency Level:      100
Time taken for tests:   0.069 seconds
Complete requests:      1000
Total transferred:      143000 bytes
Requests per second:    14459.43 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       6.916 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.069 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          2019.24 [Kbytes/sec] received
...
Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      7
  95%      7
  99%      8
 100%      8 (longest request)
```

## 4 Performance Test

Most oftenly, performance test should focus on metrics such as QPS, lantency.
But at the time of writing this post, I care more about bandwidth. So in the
following, i will configure nginx as a file server, and do bandwidth test with
`ab`.

### 4.1 Change Nginx Settings

Turn our nginx into a file server, change the default settings of the default server:

```shell
$ cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
server {
   listen 80 default_server;
   listen [::]:80 default_server;

   root /tmp;

   location / {
       try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
   }

   # You may need this to prevent return 404 recursion.
   location = /404.html {
       internal;
   }
}
```

### 4.2 Prepare Files

Copy or generate some files to `/tmp`, here we generate with `dd`:

```shell
# size = count * bs (bytes)
/ # dd if=/dev/zero of=1_MB.data count=1024 bs=1024
/ # dd if=/dev/zero of=512_KB.data count=512 bs=1024
/ # ls -ahl
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      512.0K Nov 26 05:58 512_KB.data
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        1.0M Nov 26 04:32 1_MB.data
```

### 4.3 Performance Test

Check file existance:

```shell
/ # wget 192.168.1.4:80/1_MB.data
```

Run performance test:

```shell
/ # ab -c 100 -n 1000 http://192.168.1.4:80/1_MB.data
```

Loop for longer durations:

```shell
/ # for i in `seq 1 100`; do echo $i; ab -c 100 -n 1000 http://192.168.1.4:80/1_MB.data; sleep 5; done
```

Control the file size, concurrency and duration, and sleep interval, you will
get different bandwidths.
